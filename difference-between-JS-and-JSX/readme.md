DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JS AND JSX

-JS is a normal programming language
-JSX is a writting style that comes with react that we call syntatic sugar
-We cannot create a structure like HTML in JS, it preceives it as a string. For example if we want to create a HTML structure in js and we do this;
const element = <h1>Hello World!</h1>, it prints to screen as a string. To be able to do this in JS and access DOM  we must use ways like "createElement"
-We can write the HTML structure we want to create with JSX as in a component 
-The strongest side of JSX is; we can write JS codes in HTML structure we created 
-when we use the class attribute in the HTML tag we use the className instead
-JSX is a JS but look like HTML
-We write logical code in JS, and focuse on creating UI in JSX
